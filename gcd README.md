This program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a simple iterative approach.
The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

Features:
1.Accepts two integers as input from the user.
2.Computes the GCD by iterating through all numbers from 1 to the smaller of the two numbers.
3.Displays the GCD of the two input numbers.
